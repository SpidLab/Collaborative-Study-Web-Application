## Project Description

The Metadata Sharing Web Application is a platform designed to facilitate the secure sharing and processing of genetic data among researchers. This application allows registered researchers, both administrators and users, to upload and manage genetic metadata related to patient data. The uploaded data can be processed according to researchers' specified criteria, such as genetic similarity analysis.

### Features

- **User Authentication:** Researchers can register and log in to the platform securely, ensuring access to their respective data and processing capabilities.

- **Metadata Upload:** Researchers can upload genetic data related to patients, allowing for organized storage and analysis.

- **Data Processing:** The application enables researchers to define processing requirements, such as genetic similarity analysis, which can be applied to the uploaded metadata.

### Components

The project is divided into three main components:
1. **Backend Server:** Responsible for handling user authentication, data processing requests, and managing user sessions.
2. **Database:** Stores information related to users, sessions, and the metadata uploaded.
3. **Frontend:** Provides a user-friendly interface for researchers to interact with the application, including user registration, data upload, and processing configuration.
